# Terminal-Hangman-Game
Description:

The Terminal Hangman Game is a straightforward implementation of the classic Hangman game, created using basic C++ programming techniques. This project serves as an excellent introduction to C++ for beginners, demonstrating the use of fundamental concepts like functions, arrays, and loops.

Features:
1.	Simple Gameplay: Guess the letters of a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.
2.	Basic C++ Concepts: Utilizes functions, arrays, and loops without advanced C++ features, making it easy for beginners to understand.
3.	Terminal-Based: Runs entirely in the terminal, providing a text-based game interface.

Technologies Used:
1.	Programming Language: C++

Installation:

No installation is required for this project. Simply copy the code into your preferred C++ development environment or text editor and run it.

Steps to Run:
1.	Copy the code from the repository.
2.	Open your C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks) or a text editor.
3.	Paste the code into a new C++ file (e.g., hangman.cpp).
4.	Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ hangman.cpp -o hangman).
5.	Run the compiled program (e.g., ./hangman).
6.	Enjoy Game.
Usage:
1.	Start the Game: Run the compiled program to start playing.
2.	Gameplay: The game will display a series of underscores representing the hidden word. Guess letters one at a time to reveal the word. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
3.	Win/Loss Conditions: If you guess all the letters correctly, you win! If you run out of guesses, you lose.
